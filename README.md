# Fly

I do not know why it is called fly, but it was inspired by a music band called, *audio fly*. Alas, this project was mere simulation of how to have audio playback visually tracked by the transcript that comes with it.

## Installation

There is isn't.

## Running it

Just fire up vite.

## Playback controls

It follows the *vim* way: `h, j, k, and l` (`-5s back`, `next speaker`, `previous speaker`, '5s forward`)

## Questions?

I do not know why you would have questions, but hey, shoot your shot.

el. oh. el.
